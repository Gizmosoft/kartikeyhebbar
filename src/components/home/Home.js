          Hi! I'm Kartikey.ðŸ‘‹

        <div className='about-description'>
          &#11088;I'm a Software Engineer located in Bengaluru, India with more than 2 years of experience in Web Development, Automation, Artificial Intelligence and IT Operations related to Identity & Access Management domain. <br /><br />
          &#11088;I've worked on few personal projects in the Software Development domain and have had the opportunity to work with early-stage startups, government organizations and an IT giant like Accenture! <br /><br />
          &#11088;I'm define myself as a technology enthusiast dedicated towards learning and building web-based applications. I've worked on Spring Boot, Django and have recently dwelled into ReactJS library. Learning new things excites me and this pushed me to learn AWS recently!<br /><br />
          &#11088;I graduated from Bangalore Institute of Technology in 2020 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Telecommunication. It was during this degree where I was introduced to computer programming and I've been in love with it ever since &#128147; <br /><br />
          &#11088;I started learning various programming concepts and technologies on my own and gained some internship experiences at various companies during college. <br /><br />
          &#11088;Apart from coding & technology, I'm a huge soccer fan, a guitarist & a singer, book lover and an entrepreneurship enthusiast! &#128516; <br />
